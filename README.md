# Rainfall-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning


Rainfall Prediction is one of the difficult and uncertain tasks that have a significant impact on human society. Timely and accurate forecasting can proactively help reduce human and financial loss. This study presents a set of experiments that involve the use of common machine learning techniques to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that day in major cities in Australia.


I’ve always liked knowing the parameters meteorologists take into account before making a weather forecast, so I found the dataset interesting. From an expert’s point of view, however, this dataset is fairly straightforward.

I tried to cover bellows points- 

- How is balancing done for an unbalanced dataset
- How Label Coding Is Done for Categorical Variables
- How sophisticated imputation like MICE is used
- How outliers can be detected and excluded from the data
- How the filter method and wrapper methods are used for feature selection
- How to compare speed and performance for different popular models
- Which metric can be the best to judge the performance on an unbalanced data set: precision and F1 score.
